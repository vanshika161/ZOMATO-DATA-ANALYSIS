# Zomato Data Analysis

This project involves analyzing the Zomato dataset, which contains information about various restaurants, their ratings, locations, cuisines, and other details. The goal is to provide insights into restaurant performance, trends, and customer preferences.

### Features:
- **Data Cleaning**: Handling missing data and outliers to ensure data quality.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Exploring the dataset to uncover trends, distributions, and relationships between features.
- **Visualization**: Creating plots and charts to better understand the dataset and to present insights visually.
- **Insights**: Extracting meaningful conclusions from the data regarding restaurant ratings, cuisines, locations, and price range.

### Files:
- **`Untitled.ipynb`**: The main Jupyter notebook where the analysis and visualizations are performed.
- **`Zomato data .csv`**: The raw dataset containing details about restaurants, including ratings, cuisines, and locations.

### Installation and Setup:
1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/vanshika161/ZOMATO-DATA-ANALYSIS.git
   ```

2. **Install the required libraries**:
   Use the following command to install the necessary Python packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Run the notebook**:
   - Open the `Untitled.ipynb` file in Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab.
   - Execute the cells to load the dataset, clean the data, and visualize insights.

### How to Use:
1. Load the `Zomato data .csv` dataset into the notebook.
2. Clean and preprocess the data, including handling missing values and encoding categorical variables.
3. Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using techniques like grouping, aggregating, and filtering the data.
4. Visualize key insights using plots such as bar charts, histograms, and scatter plots.
5. Draw conclusions on restaurant performance based on factors like ratings, cuisines, and price range.

### Testing:
You can modify the dataset by adding more rows or columns, or apply other data visualization libraries (e.g., Seaborn, Plotly) to enhance the analysis.

### Project Structure:
- **`Untitled.ipynb`**: Contains the Python code for data analysis and visualization.
- **`Zomato data .csv`**: The Zomato dataset used for analysis.

### Contributing:
Feel free to fork the repository, suggest improvements, or raise issues if you encounter bugs.
